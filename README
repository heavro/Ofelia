Ofelia it's a codename for Open-ended Front-end

Ofelia will stand as a building ground for those who are interested in developing 
applications on top of ZendFramework.

We will develop the basic tools:

- (x)HTML(5)
- Basic CSS (2.1 | 3)
- Session and User control interfaces (login/logout, profiles, ACLs, etc)
- Database connections
- Logging

Don't forget to use the zf-tool to generate new
controllers/views/modules/models.

Please, participate! ;)
